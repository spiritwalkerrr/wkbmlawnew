            <br>

            <p>When a user contacts us (e.g. by e-mail or phone), the user’s information is processed in order to handle

            <h3>Types of Data processed:</h3>

            <p>Master data (e.g. names, addresses) Contact details (e.g. e-mail addresses, phone numbers) Content data

                transmitted in encrypted form by checking whether a closed-key or lock symbol appears in the address bar
                of
                your browser. In addition, we use other suitable technical and organisational security measures to
                protect
                your Data from accidental or deliberate manipulation, partial or complete loss, destruction or
                unauthorised

                developments.
